        "The developed expert system's functionality is to determine whether a student passes or fails a course. Its rules are based on a simple 'if-then' logic where a student passes if their average grade is 60 or higher, and fails otherwise. Users interact with the system by inputting a student's numerical average grade via a command-line prompt, and the system outputs the corresponding pass/fail decision.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The expert system's scenario was defined as: \"Decide if a student passes a course based on their grades,\" utilizing the student's average numerical grade as the sole input condition.\n",
        "*   A clear passing threshold was established, requiring an `average_grade` of **60** or higher to pass the course.\n",
        "*   Two distinct 'if-then' rules were outlined:\n",
        "    *   **IF** a student's `average_grade` is greater than or equal to `60`, **THEN** the student `Passes` the course.\n",
        "    *   **IF** a student's `average_grade` is less than `60`, **THEN** the student `Fails` the course.\n",
        "*   A Python function, `decide_course_status()`, was implemented as the basic rule engine, correctly applying these rules to input grades (e.g., 75 returns 'Passes', 59 returns 'Fails', and 60 returns 'Passes').\n",
        "*   An interactive user interface was developed, allowing users to input a student's average grade. It converts the input to a floating-point number, uses the rule engine to determine the course status, and displays the result. Basic error handling is included for non-numerical inputs.\n",
        "*   Testing instructions were provided for various scenarios, including passing grades (e.g., 85), failing grades (e.g., 45), the exact passing threshold (60), and invalid inputs (e.g., 'abc'), confirming the system's accurate decision-making and error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current expert system effectively automates a straightforward pass/fail decision based on a single numerical criterion, offering a foundational example of rule-based decision support.\n",
        "*   To enhance the system, consider expanding its capabilities to incorporate more complex decision logic, such as multiple weighted criteria (e.g., attendance, project scores) or tiered outcomes (e.g., 'distinction', 'merit', 'pass', 'fail'), moving beyond a simple binary decision.\n"
